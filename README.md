# Pulse
I tried to come up with a name that was somehow related to 'push' and 'pull request'.

## Description
Just a silly little script that I run when I want to push commits to a remote branch and open the pull request URL in one go.

Wrote it with Node because it was easier than learning how to shell script.

## Installation (working from a unix-ish environment)
1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed
1. Clone this repo
1. `cd pulse`
1. `npm i -g`
